# Temporal Brain Networks Code

This repository contains the Julia code used in the paper *On null models for temporal small-worldness in brain
dynamics* by Aurora Rossi, Samuel Deslauriers-Gauthier, and Emanuele Natale. The full paper is available on [HAL](https://hal.science/hal-04389639/). 

The data used in this study are collected in the [Temporal Brain Networks Dataset](https://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.57745%2FPR8VUV).
